# Jenkins-Build-Triggers-Remotely
This is to trigger Jenkins's job remotely using Jenkins API. ***Trigger builds Remotely*** feature provides flexibility that allows triggering a job from the script, command line, GitHub hook when somebody has committed a change or triggers a job from one server to another
<br>
### 3 steps to implement a remote Jenkins build trigger:
> **1. Configure a job to trigger from remote and generate its job URL** <br>
>
> **2. Generate Token for User** <br>
>
> **3. Generate CRUMB** <br>

### <ins> Step 1:</ins>  Configure a job to trigger from remote and generate its job URL
- In Jenkins dashboard, select a **Job  &rarr;  Configure   &rarr;   Build Triggers**
- Check mark on **Trigger builds remotely**
- Give a **Authentication token** name
- Generate URL & save in a file

### <ins> Step 2:</ins> Generate Token for User
The ***authentication token*** is a token-based credentials that grant authorization to trigger the job. The token can be generated by Jenkins's user.

- Click on the **username** drop-down icon from the top right corner of the Jenkins server page and click on the **Configure** option.
- **Configure  &rarr;  API Token  &rarr; Add new token  &rarr;  Generate**
- Copy token name and save it as **username:tokenname** in a file


### <ins> Step 3:</ins> Generate CRUMB
- wget command is required for this, so download wget binary for git bash
- Extract content in c:/program files/Git/mingw64/bin
- Run below command in Git Bash, (replace username,password,Jenkins URL)
```sh
wget -q --auth-no-challenge --user username --password password --output-document - 'http://JENNKINS_IP:8080/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)'
```
- Save the output **Jenkins-Crumb** token in a file
